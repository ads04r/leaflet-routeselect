leaflet-routeselect
===================

A custom control for Leaflet. Designed to allow routes on maps to be shown or hidden by the user.

Written for maps.southampton.ac.uk, initially for bus route showing/hiding, but
eventually will be used for cycle routes and whatever else we think of.

Pretty bland at the minute, I hope to add things like styling, ordering and the
like later on.

This part of the code, despite being moved to its own repo, should still be considered
pre-v1.0 and the interface and whatnot may change without notice.
